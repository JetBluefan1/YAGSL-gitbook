# SparkMAX Common Problems

## SparkMAX Absolute Encoder Boards

The [SparkMAX Absolute Encoder board](https://www.revrobotics.com/rev-11-3326/) should be zip tied and hot glued to the SparkMAX for redundancy and to prevent the board from coming loose.

### Throughbore Connection to the absolute encoder board

The connector from the [SparkMax Absolute Encoder board](https://www.revrobotics.com/rev-11-3326/) and the [REV Throughbore](https://www.revrobotics.com/rev-11-1271/) should be hot glued down on **BOTH** connection points because these can come out easily!&#x20;

The wire should also be tensioned just right, if its over tensioned the wire mgiht not be fully in the connector and the data could be incomplete, corrupted, or unnavailable.

## Status Frame Error

Usually if there's a status frame error it means that your connection to the REV Throughbore is incomplete somehow, or the sensor cable from your motor is loose or broken!&#x20;

If you see this be sure to check **ALL SENSOR CABLES GOING INTO THAT SPARKMAX!**
